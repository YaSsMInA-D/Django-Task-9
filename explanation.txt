What the register_view function does:

When someone goes to the registration page:

1. If they just opened the page:
   - Show them an empty registration form

2. If they filled the form and clicked submit (POST request):
   - Check if the information is correct
   - If everything is good: save the new user and go to home page
   - If there are mistakes: show the form again with error messages

What makes it work:
- UserCreationForm: Ready-made form from Django for signing up
- form.is_valid(): Checks if passwords match and are strong enough
- form.save(): Puts the new user in the database
- redirect(): Moves user to another page after success
